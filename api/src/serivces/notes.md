Key intraday reference price used by institutional traders.



1. Match Your Largest Indicator Window
Why: Many traders choose a historical window long enough to fully cover the largest indicator period they’ll be using (plus some extra).

Example: If your longest technical indicator is a 200-period (bar) moving average, you need at least 200 bars of data to make that indicator meaningful—and in practice, you want more than 200 bars to allow for “warm-up” (so the initial calculation isn’t skewed).

For intraday 15-minute data:

One full trading day often has around 26 intervals (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM = 6.5 hours = 26 x 15-minute bars).

If you want 200 intervals, that’s roughly 8 trading days of 15-minute bars.

If you’re using something like a 14-period RSI or a 26/12/9 MACD, these don’t necessarily require hundreds of days’ worth of bars to initialize—still, you typically want at least a few weeks (20–30 trading days) to gather enough historical data for stable signals.

2. Common Practice for Short-Term (Intraday) Models
2 Weeks to 3 Months of Intraday Data: Many short-term traders find that 2 weeks to 3 months of intraday data (on a given interval) strikes a balance between having enough data for indicator calculations and still capturing current market conditions.

Longer Windows if Volatility Varies: If volatility or market regime changes significantly (e.g., from a low-vol environment to a high-vol environment), a shorter window might help you stay “in sync” with the latest price behavior. But if your strategy relies on capturing bigger cyclical patterns, a longer window might be more informative.

3. Indicator-Specific Guidelines
While the above is a general rule, here are some rough pointers by indicator type:

Momentum/oscillators (RSI, Stochastics)

Typical lookback: 14 periods.

Practically, you’ll want at least a few weeks (or more) of data to get stable readings and to see how RSI behaves across multiple trading sessions.

Trend-following (Moving Averages, MACD)

Short MAs (like 10, 20, 50 bars) need fewer bars to initialize, but a handful of days may still be enough to settle initial values.

Longer MAs (100, 200 bars) require more data; to reliably see crossovers, plan for at least as many bars as the longest MA plus a buffer.

Volatility measures (Bollinger Bands, ATR)

Often use 14 or 20 bars by default.

Again, you’ll want enough historical data to see multiple “high/low volatility” cycles. A few weeks to a few months is common.

Volume-based indicators (OBV, ADL)

Usually accumulate continuously. Even a short lookback might “start” the indicator, but you’d want at least a few weeks to see how volume trends evolve intraday.

4. Practical Recommendation
Minimum: 4 to 6 weeks of 15-minute data (roughly 20–30 trading days) if you’re using short- to medium-length technical indicators.

Better Coverage: 2–3 months (40–60 trading days) if you want more stable estimates, especially if you use longer MAs or rely heavily on multi-week patterns.

Extensive: 6+ months or 1+ years of intraday data if you want to capture multiple market regimes (e.g., periods of high vs. low volatility) or test a broad variety of conditions.

Final Thoughts
Adapt to Market Changes: If your strategy is very short-term or your market undergoes fast regime shifts, focusing on a shorter, more recent window might improve responsiveness.

Model Training vs. Indicator Calculation: If you’re training a machine-learning model, you’ll generally want as much data as possible. For calculating standard technical indicators, the “lookback” primarily determines how many bars you need to initialize.

Data Availability: Alpha Vantage’s “full” intraday mode can return ~20 years of data (though older intraday data can be spotty depending on the symbol). Evaluate how far back you truly need to go for your particular trading approach or research goals.

Overall, a comfortable rule of thumb is to gather at least a few weeks of 15-minute data to ensure your technical indicators are stabilized and your model has a decent sample of recent market conditions. Then adjust up or down based on the complexity and length of your indicators—and your practical constraints (API limits, memory, data usage, etc.).
