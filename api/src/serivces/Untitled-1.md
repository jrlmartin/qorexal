## Title: Duolingo Launches Its Biggest Expansion Yet With 148 New Courses
## URL: https://www.benzinga.com/tech/25/04/45114080/duolingo-launches-its-biggest-expansion-yet-with-148-new-courses
## Tags: AI Generated, Briefs, Stories That Matter
## Channels: News, Top Stories, Tech, General
## Content: Mobile learning platform **Duolingo Inc.** (NASDAQ:[DUOL](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DUOL#NASDAQ)) has [introduced its most extensive](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/04/g45093631/duolingo-launches-148-new-language-courses-expands-access-to-popular-languages-including-japanese-) course expansion to date, launching 148 new language programs on its platform.

This substantial growth more than doubles its existing offerings. The launch makes Duolingo's top seven non-English languages, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin accessible across all 28 of its supported interface languages.

In the past, developing a single language course on Duolingo could take several years. But with the help of generative AI, enhanced internal tools, and a new shared content system, the company has shortened that process, rolling out its newest set of courses in less than a year.

**Also Read: _[Marriott Bets $355M On Trendy CitizenM Hotels To Woo Modern Travelers](https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/04/45040811/marriott-bets-355m-on-trendy-citizenm-hotels-to-woo-modern-travelers)_**

"Developing our first 100 courses took about 12 years, and now, in about a year, we're able to create and launch nearly 150 new courses. This is a great example of how generative AI can directly benefit our learners," said CEO and co-founder **Luis von Ahn**.

This shared content model enables the creation of a core course structure that can be quickly adapted for multiple languages.

The majority of the newly launched courses are designed for beginners, aligning with A1â€“A2 levels on the CEFR scale, and include interactive tools such as Stories and DuoRadio to help reading and listening comprehension.

Duolingo noted that higher-level content is expected to be added in the coming months.

The release is especially impactful in regions where access to non-English courses was previously limited. In Latin America, Spanish and Portuguese speakers now have access to Asian languages like Japanese, Mandarin, and Korean.

In Europe, learners speaking languages such as French, German, or Italian can also explore these new additions.

Meanwhile, in Asia, speakers of languages like Hindi, Thai, and Tamil can now learn any of the top seven languages, whereas previously, their options were largely restricted to English.

**Price Action**: DUOL shares traded higher by 0.35% at $386.48 at last check Wednesday.

## Content: **Duolingo Inc** (NASDAQ:[DUOL](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DUOL#NASDAQ)) [stock traded higher](https://www.benzinga.com/topic/duolingo) on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter financial results on Thursday.

Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on the stock.

Needham analyst Ryan MacDonald maintained Duolingo with a Buy and raised the [price target from](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/DUOL/analyst-ratings) $400 to $460.

**Also Read: [Duolingoâ€™s AI Investments Set The Stage For Long-Term Growthâ€”Analyst Sees Stock Hitting $400](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/25/02/44047945/duolingos-ai-investments-set-the-stage-for-long-term-growth-analyst-sees-stock-hitting-400)**

The company reported quarterly revenue growth of 38% to $230.74 million, beating the analyst consensus estimates of $222.98 million. EPS of $0.72 beat the [analyst consensus estimate](https://investors.duolingo.com/investor-relations) of $0.51.

This quarterâ€™s top-line outperformance was mainly driven by Subscriptions, which topped estimates, driven by better-than-expected subscriber count and revenue per subscriber. Paid subscribers came in at 10.3 million for the quarter, above the consensus of 10.12 million. Gross margins exceeded the analyst estimate of 70.0% at 71.1% but were down from 73.0% a year ago.

The decline was expected and due to a combination of lower subscription margins from increased generative AI costs associated with increased Duolingo Max adoption. However, management noted they benefited from some earlier-than-expected cost optimization and higher than anticipated advertising gross margin in other revenue.

Daily active users (DAUs) were 46.6 million, an increase of 49%, and monthly active users (MAUs) were 130.2 million, an increase of 33%.

A viral campaign helps drive record MAU adds, while Max adoption continues at a similar rate to the fourth quarter. Subscription bookings were strong in the quarter, with Y/Y growth at 43.8% versus the analystâ€™s 35% growth estimate, resulting in subscription bookings of $232.2 million, above the consensus of $218.5 million.

Duolingo expects second-quarter revenue of $238.50 million-$241.50 million versus the $233.76 million analyst consensus estimate. MacDonald expects quarterly revenue of $240.12 million.

Duolingo raised its fiscal 2025 revenue outlook from $962.50 million-$978.50 million to $987.00 million-$996.00 million versus the $977.16 million estimate. MacDonald expects fiscal revenue of $991.51 million.

Duolingo stock continued its strong run to start 2025, with shares up 23.4% year-to-date and 79.4% in the past year. While the stock is trading at a premium multiple to the comp group, and MacDonaldâ€™s new price target represents a 22.1 times EV/sales multiple on his fiscal 2025 estimates, the analyst noted that the strong year-end subscription bookings likely translate into subscription revenue growth in the mid-40s range for fiscal 2025 versus the current consensus of 38.3%.

**Price Action**: DUOL shares traded higher by 18.5% at $474.13 at last check Friday.
