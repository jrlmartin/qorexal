Committee assignments in particular, often draw red flags from investors.\n\nGreene serves on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and the House Committee on Homeland Security with several subcommittee appointments. The congresswoman's past trade in technology and cybersecurity stocks has drawn attention with her role within Homeland Security.\n\nGreene’s past trades of Palantir Technologies and a [Bitcoin ETF](https://www.benzinga.com/25/03/44255172/marjorie-taylor-greene-buys-more-bitcoin-etf-shares-ahead-of-trumps-strategic-reserve-executive-order) have drawn criticism along with the timing of her trades, as she is a close ally to President **Donald Trump.**\n\nWhen asked previously about buying stocks earlier this year that soared days later after Trump announced a pause to tariffs, Greene [brushed aside the criticism.](https://www.benzinga.com/politics/25/04/44852406/marjorie-taylor-greene-brushes-off-stock-buying-criticism-says-portfolio-manager-bought-the-dip)\n\n“I think that criticism is laughable. President Trump has been talking about tariffs for decades,” Greene told reporters when asked about the trades at a recent town hall event in Georgia in a clip [shared](https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1912456434081480777) by Unusual Whales. The congresswoman used the opportunity to boast about her stock performance, which ranked her as one of the top trading members of Congress in 2024.\n\n“I don’t place my buys and sells,\" Greene said, citing an agreement she has with her portfolio manager, who handles all the buying and selling of stocks. “He did a great job. Guess what he did. He bought the dip. And that’s what anybody that has financial sense does.\"\n\nGreene also said her portfolio manager did not have inside information, everything was public and a potential tariff pause wasn’t a secret.\n\nSen. **Josh Hawley** (R-Mo.) has reintroduced legislation that would ban members of Congress from trading or holding individual stocks.\n\nThe bill is known as the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act, or PELOSI Act based on the first letter of each of the main words. The name takes aim at the congresswoman and former Speaker of the House **Nancy Pelosi** (D-Calif.).  \n\n“Members of Congress should be fighting for the people they were elected to serve — not day trading at the expense of their constituents,” Hawley [said](https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-reintroduces-pelosi-act-to-ban-congress-from-trading-stocks/). “Americans have seen politician after politician turn a profit using information not available to the general public.”\n\nHawley said the bill will help “restore Americans’ trust in our nation’s legislative body.”\n\nHawley’s bill is being reintroduced as President **Donald Trump** [said](https://time.com/7280114/donald-trump-2025-interview-transcript/) he would support such a ban.\n\n“Well, I watched Nancy Pelosi get rich through insider information, and I would be okay with it. If they send it to me, I would do it,” Trump told TIME.\n\nTrump said he would sign the ban if the bill passes Congress.\n\nWhile Pelosi makes headlines for her trades, it’s important to remember that [it is both Republican](https://www.benzinga.com/politics/25/04/44852406/marjorie-taylor-greene-brushes-off-stock-buying-criticism-says-portfolio-manager-bought-the-dip) and Democratic members of Congress who are profiting from buying and selling stocks and options while in office, with some trades coming with questionable timing or having a connection to committees they serve on.\n\nIn 2024, a list of the top-performing traders in Congress included six Republicans and four Democrats.\n\n**Did You Know?**\n\n*   **Congress Is Making Huge Investments.

              "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ)) is quietly entering the AI coding assistant space, and it's doing it alongside [**Anthropic**](https://www.benzinga.com/25/05/45160136/nvidia-blasts-anthropic-for-backing-stricter-chip-bans-on-china-focus-on-innovation-than-tell-tall-tales), one of the most heavily funded artificial intelligence startups in the world.\n\nBacked by Amazon (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ)) with a $4 billion investment, including an initial $1.25 billion with an option for an additional $2.75 billion, and Google, with a $500 million upfront investment and a commitment of up to $2 billion total, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-agrees-invest-up-2-bln-openai-rival-anthropic-wsj-2023-10-27/), Anthropic is now collaborating with Apple to launch a new [AI](https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/05/45184302/bill-gates-daughter-launches-phia-a-850k-ai-powered-fashion-app-with-backing-from-kris-jenner-and-desiree-gruber)\\-enhanced coding tool built into Xcode, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-02/apple-anthropic-team-up-to-build-ai-powered-vibe-coding-platform).\n\n**Don't Miss:**\n\n*   **‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

Internally dubbed a \"vibe-coding\" interface, the assistant is designed to let Apple engineers build full software components using natural language, which is a step forward in the tech giant’s growing effort to embed generative AI into its core development tools.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, this marks one of Apple's first direct partnerships with a major AI player amid growing competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ)), which has already integrated **OpenAI'**s GPT technology into GitHub Copilot, a popular AI pair-programming assistant.\n\n**Trending:** **Donald Trump just announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal — [**here's how you can invest in the entertainment market's next big disruptor at $2.25 per share**](https://www.benzinga.com/money/seize-a-share-while-you-still-can-in-the-2-trillion-entertainment-market-with-elf-labs-at-just-2-25-share)****.**\n\nClaude Sonnet Brings Amazon and Google's Firepower Into Apple's Walled Garden\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith funding exceeding $7 billion, [Built In San Francisco](https://www.builtinsf.com/articles/anthropic-launches-claude-3-20240304) reports, and strategic backing from two giants, Claude is quickly positioning itself as a rival to OpenAI's GPT-4, according to [Tom’s Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/i-tested-chatgpt-4o-vs-claude-3-7-sonnet-with-5-tough-prompts-and-this-one-crushed-the-competition). The Claude family of models is known for high performance in reasoning, code generation, and low hallucination rates, making it an ideal choice for professional-level AI coding applications, [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/claude)‘s website states.\n\nApple's decision to integrate Claude Sonnet into Xcode represents a notable departure from its typical vertically integrated approach. According to Bloomberg, this tool will initially be used internally, but discussions are ongoing about a broader rollout to external developers. Developers will be able to request bug fixes, test interface elements, or even write entire blocks of Swift code using natural language prompts, Bloomberg reports.\n\nWhile Apple previously teased a native Swift Assist tool in 2024 according to [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/apple-announced-swift-assist-wwdc24-so-where-is-it/), it was never released. Reports now suggest that Claude Sonnet may quietly replace Swift Assist behind the scenes as Apple ramps up internal AI infrastructure and evaluates the tool's long-term integration potential, Bloomberg writes.\n\n**_See Also: Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary called Missing Ring his biggest mistake — Don't repeat history—[**_invest in RYSE at just $1.90/share._**](https://www.benzinga.com/money/big-tech-has-spent-billions-acquiring-ai-smart-home-startups-one-company-stands-to-benefit-and-has-already-made-10-million)_**\n\nA Growing Battlefield in AI-Driven Development\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWith Amazon leveraging Claude to power enterprise-level AWS offerings, Google collaborating on AI safety research, and Apple’s plans to integrate the tool into Xcode, the Claude ecosystem is expanding rapidly across industries, now including one of the most powerful hardware companies in the world.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple remains cautious about a public rollout but sees strategic value in internal deployment to sharpen its AI expertise. Whether or not the Claude-powered Xcode assistant becomes public, this partnership may reflect Apple's acknowledgment that external AI platforms will likely play a growing role in the future of its software tools.\n\n**Read Next:**\n\n*   **[Invest Where It Hurts — And Help Millions Heal: Invest in Cytonics and help disrupt a $390B Big Pharma stronghold.](https://www.benzinga.com/money/a-cure-for-osteoarthritis-powered-by-everyday-investors-cytonics-is-looking-to-beat-big-pharma-and-disrupt-a-390-billion-market)**\n*   **Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – [**Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.30/share!**](https://www.benzinga.com/money/mode-mobile-2)**\n\n_**Image: Shutterstock**_",
