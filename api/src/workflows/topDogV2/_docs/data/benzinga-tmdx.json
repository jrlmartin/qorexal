      "body": "<p>In the current session, the stock is trading at $88.30, after a <strong>3.42%</strong> spike. Over the past month, <strong>TransMedics Group Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TMDX#NASDAQ\">TMDX</a>)</strong> stock increased by <strong>28.27%</strong>, and in the past year, by <strong>4.92%</strong>. With performance like this, long-term shareholders are optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.</p>\n<p><p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2025/1744920017_0_0.png\" alt=\"Past Year Chart\" /></p></p>\n<h3>TransMedics Group P/E Compared to Competitors</h3>\n<p>The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&amp;P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. </p>\n<p>TransMedics Group has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of <strong>128.57</strong> of the Health Care Equipment &amp; Supplies industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. </p>\n<p><p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2025/1744920017_1.png\" alt=\"Guage\" /></p></p>\n<p>In summary, while the price-to-earnings ratio is a valuable tool for investors to evaluate a company's market performance, it should be used with caution. A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. Moreover, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that investors should consider when making investment decisions, and it should be evaluated alongside other financial ratios, industry trends, and qualitative factors. By taking a comprehensive approach to analyzing a company's financial health, investors can make well-informed decisions that are more likely to lead to successful outcomes. </p>",

      "body": "<p>On CNBC's &#8220;Mad Money Lightning Round,&#8221; <strong>Jim Cramer </strong>recommended buying <strong>GRAIL, Inc</strong>. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GRAL#NASDAQ\">GRAL</a>), adding that he likes the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/GRAL\">stock a lot.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supporting his view, Morgan Stanley analyst Tejas Savant, on March 18, raised the price target on the stock from $16 to $20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That' like a dice roll,&#8221; Cramer said when asked about <strong>Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A.S</strong>. (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TKC#NYSE\">TKC</a>). &#8220;That's a bridge too far for me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the earnings front, Turkcell, on Feb. 27, posted an FY net profit of 23.52 billion Lira versus a year-ago profit of 18.13 billion Lira.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about <strong>Block, Inc</strong>. (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/XYZ#NYSE\">XYZ</a>), he said, &#8220;I'm going to say buy half right now, and then if it breaks down below 53, then you can buy more.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods analyst Vasundhara Govil, on March 18, upgraded Block from Market Perform to Outperform but lowered the price target from $87 to $80.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Healthpeak Properties, Inc</strong>.

(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/RBRK#NYSE\">RBRK</a>) is doing &#8220;very, very well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the recent news, NTT DATA partnered with Rubrik on Monday for cybersecurity ransomware protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cramer said <strong>Edwards Lifesciences Corporation</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/EW#NYSE\">EW</a>) is a hold and prefers <strong>Boston Scientific Corporation</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BSX#NYSE\">BSX</a>) to Edwards Lifesciences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the earnings front, Edwards Lifesciences, on Feb. 11, posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have to wait another quarter,&#8221; Cramer said when asked about <strong>Shake Shack Inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SHAK#NYSE\">SHAK</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wells Fargo analyst Anthony Trainor, on Wednesday, initiated coverage on Shake Shack with an Equal-Weight rating and announced a price target of $95.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TransMedics Group, Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TMDX#NASDAQ\">TMDX</a>) is an &#8220;interesting&#8221; company, Cramer said. &#8220;I'm not going to necessarily recommend it right here.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needham analyst Mike Matson reiterated TransMedics Group with a Hold rating on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It's never been this cheap that I can recall,&#8221; Cramer said when asked about <strong>Arista Networks Inc</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ANET#NYSE\">ANET</a>). &#8220;Here's the problem, it's a data center stock.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 5, UBS analyst David Vogt upgraded Arista Networks from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $112 to $115.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri shares fell 2.3% to settle at $6.08 on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GRAIL shares gained 0.7% to close at $28.58 during the session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arista Networks&#8217; shares fell 3.3% to settle at $78.96.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shake Shack shares rose 0.3% to settle at $93.62.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TransMedics Group shares gained 0.2% to close at $70.44.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubrik shares fell 3.8% to settle at $66.00.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edwards Lifesciences&#8217; shares rose 0.1% to close at $71.19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block shares fell 3.5% to settle at $56.99 on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthpeak Properties shares fell 0.4% to close at $20.22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Read:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/03/44534563/netflix-vertex-pharmaceuticals-and-more-on-cnbcs-final-trades\">Netflix, Vertex Pharmaceuticals And More On CNBC&#8217;s &#8216;Final Trades&#8217;</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock </em></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>TransMedics Gr's</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TMDX#NYSE\">TMDX</a>) short percent of float has fallen 3.35% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has <strong>10.76 million shares sold short</strong>, which is 38.99% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 8.66 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock?adType=benzinga-insights&amp;ad=short-interest&amp;campaign=wallstreetadvantage\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest?adType=benzinga-insights&amp;ad=short-interest&amp;campaign=wallstreetadvantage\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\n<h3>TransMedics Gr Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2025/1740753034_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for TransMedics Gr has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>\n<h3>Comparing TransMedics Gr's Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pro/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, TransMedics Gr's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 8.03%, which means the company has <strong>more</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze?adType=benzinga-insights&amp;ad=short-interest&amp;campaign=wallstreetadvantage\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a></p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>",
