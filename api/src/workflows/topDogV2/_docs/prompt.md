The goal is for `o1 pro` to anlayze a dataset to find the mid cap stocks that could be most bullish for day trading based on news articles and other data sets.

rules:
- looking for the mid cap stocks that would spike the highest on the same day (day trading)
-  `o1 pro` will look at the data and determine which stocks have the highest potential to spike for the same day
- There will be no human intervention, no additonal software tools to assist in this process, only `o1 pro` will analyze and figure out which stocks will spike the highest based on data set
- Whatever data we inject into the system prompt, we need to make sure that o1 pro can handle it
- we need data for mid cap stocks which differ with other stocks
- we need to focus on same day trading

1. Right now, we only have news articles. What additional data would `o1 pro` need to analyze in order to make an accurate decison?
2. The output would be listing the possible bullish top stocks, say 1 ~ 3, or even zero if none seem bullish
3. also include sample data in mardkown, json, or whatever format `o1 pro` will understand best

## Content: **Duolingo Inc** (NASDAQ:[DUOL](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DUOL#NASDAQ)) [stock traded higher](https://www.benzinga.com/topic/duolingo) on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter financial results on Thursday.

Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on the stock.

Needham analyst Ryan MacDonald maintained Duolingo with a Buy and raised the [price target from](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/DUOL/analyst-ratings) $400 to $460.

The company reported quarterly revenue growth of 38% to $230.74 million, beating the analyst consensus estimates of $222.98 million. EPS of $0.72 beat the [analyst consensus estimate](https://investors.duolingo.com/investor-relations) of $0.51.

This quarter’s top-line outperformance was mainly driven by Subscriptions, which topped estimates, driven by better-than-expected subscriber count and revenue per subscriber. Paid subscribers came in at 10.3 million for the quarter, above the consensus of 10.12 million. Gross margins exceeded the analyst estimate of 70.0% at 71.1% but were down from 73.0% a year ago.

The decline was expected and due to a combination of lower subscription margins from increased generative AI costs associated with increased Duolingo Max adoption. However, management noted they benefited from some earlier-than-expected cost optimization and higher than anticipated advertising gross margin in other revenue.

Daily active users (DAUs) were 46.6 million, an increase of 49%, and monthly active users (MAUs) were 130.2 million, an increase of 33%.

A viral campaign helps drive record MAU adds, while Max adoption continues at a similar rate to the fourth quarter. Subscription bookings were strong in the quarter, with Y/Y growth at 43.8% versus the analyst’s 35% growth estimate, resulting in subscription bookings of $232.2 million, above the consensus of $218.5 million.

Duolingo expects second-quarter revenue of $238.50 million-$241.50 million versus the $233.76 million analyst consensus estimate. MacDonald expects quarterly revenue of $240.12 million.

Duolingo raised its fiscal 2025 revenue outlook from $962.50 million-$978.50 million to $987.00 million-$996.00 million versus the $977.16 million estimate. MacDonald expects fiscal revenue of $991.51 million.

Duolingo stock continued its strong run to start 2025, with shares up 23.4% year-to-date and 79.4% in the past year. While the stock is trading at a premium multiple to the comp group, and MacDonald’s new price target represents a 22.1 times EV/sales multiple on his fiscal 2025 estimates, the analyst noted that the strong year-end subscription bookings likely translate into subscription revenue growth in the mid-40s range for fiscal 2025 versus the current consensus of 38.3%.

**Price Action**: DUOL shares traded higher by 18.5% at $474.13 at last check Friday.
