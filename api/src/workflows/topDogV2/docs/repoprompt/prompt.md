Think how to build out a comprehensive Node.js implementation that pulls data from all the apis and creates the recommended JSON structure for analyzing mid-cap stocks.

- The output should look like sample.json 
- Review edge-cases.md for building options, sector rotations, Volatility, and Technical Setup Score 
- If there are items not possible becasue of the api, specify them, dont' guess.
- The code base should be well structured in typescript
