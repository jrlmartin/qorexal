# API Services Assessment for MidCap Stock Analyzer

After examining the three API services (Benzinga, EODHD, and Tradier) and reviewing the high-overview.md blueprint, I've assessed the optimal API services for each data component needed to build the MidCap Stock Analyzer application.

## Overall Assessment

The current API services provide most of the data required for the application, with a few gaps that may require custom implementation or alternative data sources. The selection of APIs is based on comparative assessment of which service provides the best data for each specific task.

## 1. MidCapScreenerService

**Method: findMidCapStocks()**
- API Service Data: EODHD's `getFundamentals()` to get market capitalization data (more complete fundamental data)
- Config already defines midCapRange as $2B-$10B
- **Missing Data**: There's no efficient screening API to directly query all stocks within a market cap range. Would need to query each stock individually or maintain a database of pre-screened stocks.

## 2. MarketDataService 

**Method: getMarketData()**
- API Service Data:
  - Market indices: Tradier's `getQuotes()` for SPY, QQQ, IWM (better real-time data with market-time awareness)
  - Sector performance: Tradier's `getQuotes()` for sector ETFs (real-time quotes)
  - VIX data: Tradier's `getQuotes()` for VIX index (market-time aware data)
  - Economic calendar: EODHD's `getEconomicCalendar()` (more comprehensive calendar data)
  - Market-wide put/call ratio: Calculated from Tradier's `getOptionsChains()` (better options data)
  - Sector rotation: Uses processed data from SectorRotationService
  - Market status: Tradier's `getMarketClock()` and `getMarketCalendar()` (real-time market status awareness)
- **Missing Data**: None, all core market data can be retrieved from the available APIs

## 3. StockDataService

**Method: getStockData()**
- API Service Data:
  - Basic stock info: EODHD's `getFundamentals()` provides company name, sector, industry, market cap, float (more complete fundamental data)
  - Price data: 
    - Current price: Tradier's `getQuotes()` (better real-time quotes)
    - Pre-market: Tradier's `getPreMarketData()` (specialized pre-market data)
    - Historical prices: EODHD's `getHistoricalEOD()` (more flexible filtering and adjustment options)
    - Intraday with VWAP: Tradier's `getIntradayData()` (better time granularity and VWAP calculations)
  - Volume data: Tradier's quote endpoints for current volume, EODHD for historical volume analysis
  - Technical indicators: EODHD's `getRSI()`, `getMACD()`, `getBollingerBands()`, `getADX()`, `getATR()`, `getMovingAverage()` (more comprehensive indicators with adjustable parameters)
  - Options data: Tradier's `getOptionsChains()` (complete Greeks and real-time pricing)
  - Earnings data: EODHD's `getEarnings()` and `getEarningsTrends()` (historical earnings surprises and forecasts)
  - News data: Benzinga's `getNewsBlocks()` (rich metadata with stock tagging)
- **Missing Data**: Pattern recognition requires custom implementation as EODHD's is marked as "Broken"

## 4. ScoringService

**Methods: calculateVolatilityScore() and calculateTechnicalSetupScore()**
- API Service Data: Uses processed data from StockDataService which already collects optimal data from each API
- **Missing Data**: None, uses data that's already been collected

## 5. PatternRecognitionService

**Method: detectPatterns()**
- API Service Data: Custom implementation using EODHD's historical price data
- **Missing Data**: Since EODHD's pattern recognition is marked as "Broken," a custom implementation is needed using the historical price data

## 6. OptionsService

**Method: extractOptionsData()**
- API Service Data: Tradier's `getOptionsChains()` (comprehensive options data including Greeks, better real-time options pricing with bid/ask spreads, includes open interest data)
- **Missing Data**: None, Tradier provides complete options data structure with real-time pricing

## 7. SectorRotationService

**Method: calculateSectorRotation()**
- API Service Data: 
  - Current sector performance: Tradier's `getQuotes()` for sector ETFs (real-time quotes)
  - Historical sector performance: EODHD's historical data (longer history with flexible adjustment options)
- **Missing Data**: None, combination of Tradier and EODHD provides optimal sector analysis

## Specific Data Points and Their Optimal API Sources

### Market Data
- Market indices: Tradier's `getQuotes()` (real-time awareness)
- Sector performance: Tradier's `getQuotes()` for sector ETFs (real-time quotes)
- VIX: Tradier's `getQuotes()` for VIX index (market-time aware data)
- Put/call ratio: Calculated from Tradier's `getOptionsChains()` (better options data)
- Sector rotation: Combination of Tradier (current) and EODHD (historical)
- Macro events: EODHD's `getEconomicCalendar()` (more comprehensive calendar data)
- Market status: Tradier's `getMarketClock()` and `getMarketCalendar()` (real-time market status)

### Stock Data
- Basic info: EODHD's `getFundamentals()` (more complete fundamental data)
- Float: EODHD's `getFundamentals()` > SharesStats > SharesFloat
- Volume metrics: 
  - Current volume: Tradier's quotes (real-time data)
  - Historical volume: EODHD's historical data (better for analysis)
- Price data: 
  - Previous close/current: Tradier's `getQuotes()` (market-time awareness)
  - Pre-market: Tradier's `getPreMarketData()` (specialized pre-market data)
  - Day range: Tradier's `getQuotes()` (real-time high/low)
  - Moving averages: EODHD's `getMovingAverage()` (customizable parameters)
  - Opening range: Calculated from Tradier's `getTimeSales()` for first hour (better time granularity)
  - VWAP: Tradier's `getIntradayData()` (better VWAP calculations)

### Technical Indicators
- RSI: EODHD's `getRSI()` (more sophisticated indicators)
- MACD: EODHD's `getMACD()` (adjustable parameters)
- ATR: EODHD's `getATR()` (customizable indicators)
- Bollinger Bands: EODHD's `getBollingerBands()` (more comprehensive)
- ADX: EODHD's `getADX()` (better technical analysis)
- Patterns: Custom implementation needed (EODHD's is broken)

### Options Data
- Call/put ratio: Calculated from Tradier's `getOptionsChains()` (comprehensive options data)
- Options flow: Custom analysis using Tradier's options data (includes Greeks and open interest)

### Earnings Data
- Recent report: EODHD's `getEarnings()` (historical earnings surprises)
- Trends: EODHD's `getEarningsTrends()` (better earnings forecasts)

### News Data
- Recent articles: Benzinga's `getNewsBlocks()` (specialized in financial news with rich metadata)
- News sentiment: **Missing** - would require custom sentiment analysis of Benzinga news content

## Identified Gaps and Missing Data

1. **Efficient Stock Screening**: No direct API method to find all stocks within a specific market cap range
   
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Custom implementation required using EODHD's historical price data

3. **News Sentiment Analysis**: Custom analysis needed using Benzinga's news content

4. **First Hour Trading Analysis**: Requires calculation from Tradier's `getTimeSales()` data (provides best time granularity)

5. **Historical Tracking**: No database component mentioned for storing analysis results over time

6. **Relative Volume Calculation**: Custom calculation needed from historical average volume (using EODHD data)

7. **Unusual Options Activity Detection**: Custom analysis using Tradier's options chain data (most comprehensive options data)

The approach leverages each API for its strengths: Tradier for real-time and intraday data, EODHD for fundamentals and technical indicators, and Benzinga for news. This optimal combination provides the best data quality for each component of the MidCap Stock Analyzer application.
