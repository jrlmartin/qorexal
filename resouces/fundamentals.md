To form a more comprehensive short-term outlook on a stock beyond just the latest news, you generally want to consider a balance of technical, fundamental, and market-related factors. Some of the key pieces of information that can be helpful are:
	1.	Price History & Technical Indicators
	•	Historical price data (recent weeks/months)
	•	Trading volume patterns and changes in volume over time
	•	Support and resistance levels
	•	Common short-term technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
	•	Volatility and Beta relative to the market
	2.	Fundamental Data
	•	Recent earnings reports and guidance
	•	Revenue and earnings growth trends
	•	Profit margins and operating costs
	•	Debt levels and liquidity (e.g., current ratio)
	•	Any pending catalysts (dividends, buybacks, product launches)
	3.	Market Sentiment & Analyst Perspectives
	•	Analyst upgrades/downgrades and target price changes
	•	Short interest (if high, it can indicate potential volatility)
	•	Options activity (particularly put/call ratios and open interest that can hint at market expectations)
	4.	Industry & Competitor Context
	•	Industry trends (are tailwinds or headwinds affecting everyone in the sector?)
	•	Competitor news (which may affect market share and investor sentiment)
	•	Regulatory environment or changes that may impact the sector
	5.	Macro and Market-Wide Indicators
	•	Overall market direction (e.g., S&P 500, Nasdaq performance)
	•	Relevant macro data (interest rates, inflation data, employment data) impacting investor sentiment
	•	Foreign exchange rates if the company has significant international exposure
	6.	Company-Specific Factors
	•	Corporate strategy (management changes, expansions, M&A activity)
	•	Shareholder structure (major institutional holdings, insider transactions)
	•	Product pipeline or services pipeline (especially relevant for tech, biotech, etc.)

Gathering and interpreting these data points can help in forming a more robust short-term prediction. Remember, short-term markets can be heavily influenced by technicals, momentum, and sentiment. Even comprehensive research does not guarantee accuracy, so risk management (setting proper stop-loss levels, position sizing, etc.) is essential.
